# Student-Marks-Visualizer
Developed a simple Python application to input subject-wise marks and visualize the results using a bar chart. The tool dynamically handles any number of subjects and generates a clean graphical representation of performance using matplotlib. It enhances data interpretation for students and can be extended to CSV-based inputs or pie charts.
